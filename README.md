# Tell Us a Climate Story!

## Purpose:
Most people are unaware of how their everyday actions impact the climate. Eventually, that will tremendously impact their actions against their own environment, not knowing how badly they are harming it directly or indirectly.

## Importance:
We’re on a mission to demystify the complex world of carbon footprints! Through captivating storytelling and by breaking down these hard concepts into relatable and engaging insights (Dynamic Webpage), we empower everyone to truly understand their personal impact on the planet. Let’s turn knowledge into action and inspire change—together! With a story-oriented approach, we aimed our machine learning models at simplifying people’s understanding, providing evidence, relationships, and proof based on real-life data (authentic papers).

## Approach:

### 1. Intensive Data Analysis
- Used ready-made notebooks from NASA's GHG Centre.
- Analyzed Colorado datasets to gain a clear vision of the effects of CO2 on the environment.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Ensured all data was clean and reliable for machine learning models.
- Standardized data to reduce overfitting.

### 3. Developing a Model
- Developed a binary **logistic regression model** that classifies CO2 levels in Colorado into two categories: **DANGER** or **SAFE**, based on a threshold derived from the median of historical CO2 levels in Briggsdale, Colorado, United States (CAR).

### 4. Coupled the Model with a Webpage
- Focused on simplifying output from our models and datasets into clear visualizations.
- Created a dynamic and story-driven webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with design tools like **Figma** and **Photoshop**.

### 5. Research Papers Used:
- **IPCC's "Global Warming of 1.5°C"** report provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming, analyzing historical trends in CO2 concentrations and global temperature. [IPCC Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/)
